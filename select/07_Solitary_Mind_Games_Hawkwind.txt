Unbelieving
Non-receiving
Mind is in a Void
Unforgiven
Bodydriven
Striving to avoid
Anger glowing
Can't help knowing
Hiding from the pain
Everlasting
Grains of Truth are
Gnawing at his brain

Now he wonders
Fears but wonders
Where it all will end

Never certain
Far from certain
Can the future mend?

Conscience torn out
Doesn't know how
He will ever find

Peace of mind
Warlike visions
Torment all his kind
