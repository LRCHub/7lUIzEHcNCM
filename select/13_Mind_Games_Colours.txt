Wait. I feel it changing now
The taste. Like ashes in my mouth
You say. The only thing I'll ever be is your pain
So say enough to keep them on their knees
Enough to trick the only ones you need
It's the game. Fair only when you want to play
The game. And it starts when you call me your baby
You say how I look insane
Complain how I feel no pain
Go and tell me all the things you hate in me
We go back and forth playing mind games
Wait. I feel you coming now
The chase. Is all you care about
I fake. Hating the things youmade in me
I love the pain, pain
So say enough to keep them on their knees
Enough to trick the only ones you need
It's the game. Fair only when you want to play
The game. And it starts when you call me your baby
You say how I look insane
Complain how I feel no pain
Go and tell me all the things you hate in me
We go back and forth playing mind games
You say how I look insane
Complain how I feel no
Go and tell me all the things you hate in me
We go back and forth playing mind games
