[00:03.12] (I smell your fear, I smell your fear)
[00:22.12] 
[00:20.39] There's another side that you don't know, you don't know
[00:25.86] I can't wait to get you all alone, all alone
[00:31.62] Once I'm in there, ain't no letting go, letting go
[00:37.23] Watch me turn your mind into my home
[00:55.23] 
[00:42.85] Ooh, ooh, ooh
[00:51.30] Mind-mind games until you lose control
[00:55.01] Ooh, ooh, ooh
[01:02.64] (Mind-mind games, mind games, mind games)
[01:23.14] 
[01:05.41] Now that I'm in, there's no letting go
[01:07.94] And your emptiness begins
[01:11.22] Once I grip onto your mind and soul
[01:13.67] Your brightness starts to dim
[01:16.81] Sin after sin, you won't feel no more
[01:19.03] And you've lost your trust again
[01:22.52] I know you wish you could let me know
[01:24.73] That you're praying for an end
[01:39.73] 
[01:27.41] I can lie to you and tell you you can get me out your head
[01:32.94] But I'm lovin' all the pain I'm causing you too much instead, baby
[02:05.94] 
[01:39.48] There's another side that you don't know, you don't know
[01:45.00] I can't wait to get you all alone, all alone
[01:50.68] Once I'm in there, ain't no letting go, letting go
[01:56.38] Watch me turn your mind into my home
[02:14.38] 
[02:01.65] Ooh, ooh, ooh
[02:10.24] Mind-mind games until you lose control
[02:14.20] Ooh, ooh, ooh
[02:21.64] (Mind-mind games until you lose control)
[02:41.64] 
[02:25.11] Bitch, you think you know me
[02:26.69] Holdin' back the dark force so long, call me Kenobi
[02:29.05] Thinkin' I just gotta force this song when I get lonely
[02:32.02] Take advantage, say you'll hold me close but never show me
[02:34.92] Someone told me you can only disguise and be pretend
[02:37.84] The tears manifest sometimes my only friend
[02:40.78] You'll never see them again, they hide behind a mask
[02:43.54] Thinkin' you're winnin' with all of your grinning but I got the last laugh
[03:20.54] 
[02:46.38] I can lie to you and tell you I can't get you out my head
[02:51.94] But I'm lovin' watching you think you're controlling me instead, singin'
[03:27.94] 
[02:58.34] There's another side that you don't know, you don't know
[03:04.09] I can't wait to get you all alone, all alone
[03:09.89] Once I'm in there, ain't no letting go, letting go
[03:15.35] Watch me turn your mind into my home (home, home)
[03:39.85] 
[03:20.94] Ooh, ooh, ooh
[03:29.21] Mind-mind games until you lose control
[03:33.03] Ooh, ooh, ooh
[03:40.66] Mind-mind games until you lose control
[03:59.66] 
[04:04.35] Until you lose control
